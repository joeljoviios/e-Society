Objective:
The Startup Firm, eSociety is planning to host a cloud based application for managing the financial operations typically done in a house society. The housing society gets funds for its short and long term operations by collecting monthly maintenance fees from the families who resides in a given society/apartment. In order to calculate how much funds should be collected per family on a monthly basis, is fundamentally derived from amount of corpus funds available, cash in hand and estimated cost for the planned activities to be carried or being carried out in a given financial year (April to March).
At present these details were maintained in a spreadsheet, and it has its own issues when comes to calculations, human introduced data error, missing required precession etc. in addition,the invoice being generated for any out ward payment is been done manually. Due to the manual maintenance of financial records, getting a yoy spending report is become too tedious and difficult to extract in a given amount of time.
To bring in transparency in making payments to the work being carried out in a society, its planned to bring in Maker-Checker options. This option will make a Checker (approver) to view and validate the details before approving any request for payment or any new activity.
Considering all these points, its planned to develop a web application that will perform following operations
1. User Login to the Portal via username and password
2. The application allows on boarding/managing of families living in the society.
